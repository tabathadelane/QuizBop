# QuizBop
PDX Code Guild Alumni Group Project. 

QuizBop is a full-stack web app that allows teachers to make quizzes and share them with their students.
We are going to use React for the front end, Django for back end, and use PostgreSQL for the database. We're trying to reinforce what we learned during our bootcamp as well as learn in-demand technologies.
